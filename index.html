            <p class="lead mb-4">Freelancers, also known as independent contractors, are self-employed professionals who offer their skills and services to clients on a project or contract basis, rather than working for a single company as a traditional employee.

              Here's a breakdown of what freelancers do:
              
              Work Style:
              
              Project-based: Freelancers typically work on specific projects with a defined scope and deadline. Once a project is completed, they move on to the next one.
              Multiple Clients: They often juggle multiple clients at the same time, allowing them to diversify their workload and income.
              Self-Directed: Freelancers manage their own workflow, setting their work hours and schedules. They're responsible for finding new clients, negotiating contracts, and invoicing for their services.
              Responsibilities:
              
              Finding Work: Freelancers actively seek out projects through online platforms, networking with potential clients, or marketing their services directly.
              Project Management: They manage their own time effectively, ensuring projects are delivered on time and within budget.
              Client Communication: Maintaining clear and consistent communication with clients is crucial for building trust and securing repeat business.
              Business Operations: Freelancers handle all aspects of their business, including bookkeeping, invoicing, and paying self-employment taxes.</p>
